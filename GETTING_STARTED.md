## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test aggregates and domain logic ✅
- **Integration Tests**: Test event store and read models together ✅
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows ✅
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing and benchmarks

## 📚 Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Event Sourcing Benefits
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all account changes ✅
- **Time Travel**: Query account state at any point in time ✅
- **Debugging**: Replay events to understand system behavior ✅
- **Analytics**: Rich data for business intelligence ✅
- **Compliance**: Immutable records for regulatory requirements ✅

### Functional Programming
- **Union Types**: `OneOf<Success, InsufficientFunds, AccountFrozen>` ✅
- **Option Types**: `Option<string>` for optional values ✅
- **Immutability**: Events and value objects are immutable ✅
- **Pure Functions**: Business logic without side effects ✅

### CQRS Implementation
- **Command Side**: Optimized for writes, consistency, business rules ✅
- **Query Side**: Optimized for reads, performance, reporting ✅
- **Eventual Consistency**: Read models updated asynchronously ✅
- **Scalability**: Commands and queries can scale independently ✅

## 🔧 Development Tips

1. **Start with Domain**: Focus on business logic first ✅
2. **Event-First Design**: Design events before aggregates ✅
3. **Test-Driven**: Write tests for business rules ✅
4. **CQRS Separation**: Separate read and write concerns ✅
5. **Event-Driven**: Use events to drive read model updates ✅
6. **Small Steps**: Implement one feature at a time

## 🚀 Current Status

**✅ COMPLETED:**
- Complete domain layer with comprehensive business logic
- Full event store infrastructure with RavenDB
